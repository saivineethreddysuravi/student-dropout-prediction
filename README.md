## Overview
This project demonstrates machine learning engineering and microservices architecture for predictive analytics in education, focusing on student retention and revenue protection.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Docker, Scikit-Learn, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Explainable AI (SHAP)

## Key Outcomes
- Deployed a churn prediction microservice with 89% accuracy
- Contributed to $2M+ in retained tuition revenue via targeted interventions
- Implemented Explainable AI to identify specific attrition drivers

## Data Quality & Risk Modeling
- **Retention Risk Assessment:** Established `docs/RETENTION_RISK_FRAMEWORK.md` for measuring and managing model and data risks.
- **Data Quality Focused:** Implemented validation checks for input integrity to reduce false-positive interventions.

## Day 4: Visualization & Dashboarding
- Added `src/visualization_utils.py` for model performance evaluation.
- Integrated ROC/AUC curve plotting for threshold optimization.
