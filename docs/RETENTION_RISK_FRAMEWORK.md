# Retention Risk Assessment Framework

## 1. Measurement Options for Data Quality
To maintain high accuracy for student churn prediction, the following metrics are tracked:
- **Input Integrity:** Percentage of records with valid demographic and financial aid data.
- **Label Validity:** Alignment of 'dropout' status with actual student enrollment logs.
- **Data Drift:** Tracking feature distribution changes over semesters to identify risk in the existing model.

## 2. Refinement Procedures
- Quarterly model risk assessments to evaluate predictive accuracy across diverse student cohorts.
- Refine scoring logic based on learnings from successful intervention campaigns.
