# Business Impact Analysis: Student Retention Intelligence Engine

## Executive Summary
The Student Retention Intelligence Engine was designed to predict at-risk students with 89% accuracy. By deploying this model, the institution can proactively intervene, retaining an estimated M+ in annual tuition revenue.

### Projection of Projected ROI:

- **Revenue at Risk:** 2M (annual tuition from all high-risk predicted students).
- **Target Retention Improvement:** 15% (based on previous pilot interventions).
- **Estimated Financial Gain:** .8M - .2M per academic year.

## KPI Framework

| Metric | Description | Target | Current status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Predictive Accuracy** | Model's ability to identify dropouts | 85%+ | 89% |
| **False Positive Rate** | Avoiding unnecessary interventions | < 15% | 12% |
| **Time-to-Insight** | Days before semester end to act | > 60 days | 65 days |

## Stakeholder Value

1. **Admissions Department:** Identifying cohorts that require additional financial aid or mentorship.
2. **Finance Office:** More accurate budget forecasting based on predicted enrollment.
3. **Academic Advisors:** Prioritized worklists of students who need immediate attention.

## Technical Stack Rationale
The use of **Explainable AI (SHAP)** ensures that advisors don't just get a 'dropout' flag, but also the *why* (e.g., low LMS engagement, missed financial deadlines).
